Persons with HUS should be hospitalized because their kidneys may stop working and they may develop other serious problems.

Signs that a person is developing HUS include decreased frequency of urination, feeling very tired, and losing pink color in cheeks and inside the lower eyelids. Persons with HUS should be hospitalized because their kidneys may stop working and they may develop other serious problems.
